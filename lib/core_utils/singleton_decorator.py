    Decorator to make a class a singleton by setting its metaclass to SingletonMeta.

    Args:
        cls (Type[Any]): The class to be decorated.

    Returns:
        Type[Any]: The singleton class with SingletonMeta as its metaclass.

    Limitations:
        - **Pickling Not Supported:** Singleton instances created with this decorator
          cannot be pickled. Attempting to pickle such an instance will result in a
          `TypeError` or `AttributeError`. If pickling is required, consider implementing
          custom pickling methods or using a different singleton pattern.
        - **Incompatible with Custom Metaclasses:** The singleton decorator cannot be
          applied to classes that already have a custom metaclass. Doing so will raise a
          `TypeError` due to metaclass conflicts. To use the singleton pattern with such
          classes, you'll need to implement the singleton behavior manually or adjust
          your class design.
